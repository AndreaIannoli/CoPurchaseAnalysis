# CoPurchaseAnalysis
This project implements a co-purchase analysis using Scala and Apache Spark. The goal is to compute the number of orders in which two products appear together, providing valuable insights for recommendation systems. The analysis is performed on a dataset representing orders from a grocery delivery app.
